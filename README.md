# Sneeze counter
I have been systematically tracking my sneezes for two years to get a general idea about my patterns. Every time I sneezed, I would write down the number of sneezes in a row in a Telegram message, so I could know both the total number of sneezes and the streaks.

Once the two years had passed, I developed a small script so that I filtered the information and it could be visualized in charts. The charts are generated with Matplotlib (Python) and the image with all the graphs is generated with Powerpoint.
